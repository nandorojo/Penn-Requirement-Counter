Each course has a `data-sector` and `data-foundational` attribute. 
 
The first attribute shown is a sector, and the second is a foundational.

When selecting a button, each with the class `.requirement`, you filter the courses by requirement. Each `.requirement` has a `data-requirement-filter` attribute that indicates which requirement types should be shown.

The parent `<div>` for each list has a `data-requirement-type` attribute.

## The process
Here's how it works. 

When a `.requirement` button is clicked, the `.active` class is toggled for this button and removed from other requirements of the same type. 

Then, the `data-requirement` attribute is extracted from the active `.requirement` as a search term â€“ either for the sector or foundational.

There is a function called `filterCourses()` that takes two arguments: `sector`, `foundational`.
